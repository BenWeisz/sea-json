# sea-json
ðŸŒŠ (C) json parser - As bare bones as possible

This is my second implementation after my first one was a bit more complicated [Dev Branch - CJSON](https://github.com/BenWeisz/cjson/tree/dev). In fact I never ended up pushing the finished verson before reformatting my laptop. Anywhoo... I'm going try to keep this one as simple as possible, taking some pointers (get it) from [jsmn](https://github.com/zserge/jsmn).
